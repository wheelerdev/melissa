                <p>Do you struggle with photographing wiggling toddlers? Don’t beat yourself up over it, because it’s
                    normal. However, I’ve learned several tips to still create memorable portraits of active children.
                </p><br>
                <p>These images are from a portrait session with my nephew, who is a typical toddler. He’d rather run
                    all over than stand still for a pose. When he does look at the camera, it’s only to turn away right
                    as I take the picture.
                </p><br>
                <p> As a photographer, I could cross my fingers and hope something turns out, but that is too risky.
                    Instead, I’ve developed three strategies to control portrait success with this busy age group:
                </p><br>
                <h4>Tips for photographing toddlers:</h4>
                <p>
                    1. Control what they wear
                    <br>
                    2. Control the background
                    <br>
                    3. Don’t control them

                <h4>Tip 1: Control the Outfit </h4>
                <p>Before this portrait session, discuss outfits with mom and dad. Ask them what the child will wear. If
                    it’s a family session, discuss how they will coordinate their outfits. When the outfits are well
                    planned and coordinate with the background, then the portrait is half-way complete.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    For example, in this session with my nephew, I knew we would be shooting at an urban location with
                    brick and ironwork backgrounds. Beforehand, I suggested a theme of red and black to my sister. Their
                    outfits were well coordinated and tied the image together.
                </p><br>

                <h4>Tip 2: Control the Background </h4>
                <p>A wide, clean background, with minimal distractions, is ideal for portraiture. It could be a local
                    park, flower garden, beach - anywhere that you can focus on the child without worrying about a
                    trashcan or parked car behind them.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Back to the example of my nephew, I chose a group of brick buildings to use as a clean background in
                    an urban setting. I also planned the session during a slower time of day, when it wouldn’t be as
                    crowded. The slower time of day let me focus on my nephew, instead of worrying about passing
                    strangers stepping into the frame.
                </p><br>

                <h4>Tip 3: Don't Control the Child</h4>
                <p>And my last tip – take as many pictures as you can to get what you need. Toddlers move a lot and they
                    move fast. I’ve done a few photo-shoots where I thought they were too fast and that I had nothing,
                    only to find that I’d captured a mischievous glint before the child ran off, or a shy smile before
                    it disappeared. This age is so precious with many fun expressions. Let them be themselves and those
                    precious moments will shine. Maybe that includes letting the child walk away, playing with the
                    rocks, or playing with daddy.
                </p><br>
                <p>In the end, all three steps work together. However, <strong>the key is to let them be
                        themselves.</strong> By
                    controlling their environment (and not the child), when they do give a sparkling grin or dimple up,
                    you will be ready.
                </p><br>
