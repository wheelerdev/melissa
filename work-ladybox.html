                <p>This Valentine’s, gift yourself with self-love. Self-love is one of the most important things you can
                    do for your health – especially during menstruation. When you truly love yourself, you’re happier,
                    healthier, more prosperous and able to love others.
                </p><br>
                <p>Self-love is different from self-care. While self-care focuses on actions, self-love is all about
                    building a positive relationship with yourself. Self-love is embracing who you are, imperfections
                    and all.
                </p><br>
                <p>For example, an act of self-care is ordering a period subscription box with organic tampons and
                    organic pads. While an act of self-love is speaking kindly to yourself while menstruating and
                    re-evaluating your expectations for the week.
                </p><br>
                <p>Here are more ways to practice self-love - not only during menstruation, but any time:
                </p><br>
                <h4>Speak kind words to yourself </h4>
                <p> Our words are powerful. It’s easy to slip into negative self-talk when we are feeling down or
                    uncomfortable during menstruation. Instead, choose to speak kindly to yourself. A great rule is that
                    if you wouldn’t say it to a friend then don’t say it to yourself.
                </p><br>
                <p> Another approach to positive self-talk is to recognize unrealistic expectations. Re-evaluate where
                    you’re at with your current mood and capabilities, then adjust your schedule. Move forward with
                    kindness to your body and mind.
                </p><br>
                <h4>Commit a random act of kindness</h4>
                <p>Did you know that when you are selfless, you stimulate happiness-inducing hormones that make you feel
                    better about yourself? Being self-less can be something as simple as calling a friend to ask about
                    their day, or letting someone else have a coveted parking spot. Maybe it’s paying for the person
                    behind you in line or sending a loved one a text, telling them what you admire about them. Or maybe
                    it’s sending a friend an organic period box. No matter how small, service has the remarkable effect
                    of reducing stress hormones, elevating moods and giving a sense of meaning and gratitude to life.
                </p><br>
                <h4>Nourish your body</h4>
                <p>Take the time to nourish your body with delicious, healthy foods. When experiencing a sugar or carb
                    craving, look for the healthier alternative. Healthy doesn’t mean boring. Identify what nourishes
                    your body and satiates hunger. Pair favorite fruits or veggies with nut butter or bean dip. Or look
                    into seed cycling with your menstruation cycle. Period Subscription boxes also include nourishing
                    food for menstruators, not just menstrual hygiene supplies.
                </p><br>
                <h4>Move your body</h4>
                <p>We feel better, mentally and physically, when we move our bodies – even during menstruation. The
                    benefits from movement and exercise aren’t reserved only for intense gym workouts. Enjoy a burst of
                    endorphins by dancing to favorite songs, walking outside, practicing yoga (we love Yoga with
                    Adrienne). There are so many ways to move our bodies – the trick is to find what works best for you.
                    And remember, no one has a perfect body – so don’t beat yourself up over perceived imperfections.
                </p><br>
                <h4>Find your Love Language</h4>
                <p>Do you respond best to kind words, acts of service, receiving gifts, physical touch or quality time?
                    Identifying your love language will help you better comprehend what makes you happy and how to share
                    that happiness with others. Another way to better understand your love language is to reflect on
                    what made you feel happy as a child.
                </p><br>
                <h4>Surround yourself with people who feel like sunshine</h4>
                <p>Practice self-love by removing yourself from people who suck energy and positivity from you. Instead,
                    spend time with people who make you feel energized. Recognize what it is about them that warms your
                    soul and see if you can reflect that warmth back to others.
                </p><br>
                <h4>Love yourself first to truly love others</h4>
                <p>You set an example of how to be treated by the way you treat yourself. Put yourself first by making
                    choices that improve your quality of life – like choosing to put your cell phone down and go to
                    sleep on time, or allowing yourself to say “no” to others to preserve your mental health and
                    physical well-being. When you feel better about yourself, you will be more capable of helping
                    others.
                </p><br>

                <p>Most importantly, enjoy the journey of self-love and embracing yourself. What is your favorite way to
                    focus on self-love?
                </p>
