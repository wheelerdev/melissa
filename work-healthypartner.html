                <p>October is Adopt-a-dog month, an annual focus on finding forever-homes for shelter and rescue
                    animals. Every adopted dog makes space for helping new homeless pets at shelters. Sadly, an
                    estimated 3 to 4 million animals are euthanized because of overcrowding in animal shelters every
                    year.
                </p><br>
                <p>There are many benefits of owning a pet, but first they need to transition from the shelter to family
                    life. Make it a smooth transition by welcoming your dog with these six tips:
                </p><br>
                <h4>TIP 1: PREPARE THE HOUSE</h4>
                <p> Before leaving the shelter with your new dog, make sure your home has designated spaces for them to
                    eat, drink, and sleep. <strong>Ask the shelter what food they fed your new pet, so you can stock it
                        in your
                        pantry.</strong> It will take several days to transition a dog to new food without gastronomical
                    pain.
                </p><br>
                <h4>TIP 2: DOG-PROOF EVERYTHING</h4>
                <p>Look for potential trouble spots in your home by walking slowly through the yard and each room they
                    will have access to enter. All food items should be out of reach; tuck away stray cords; remove
                    valuable objects or furniture that won’t survive nervous chewing or pet training. Observe what is
                    growing in your yard and check online to make sure it isn’t poisonous to dogs.
                </p><br>
                <h4>TIP 3: CONSIDER A CRATE</h4>
                <p>While it might seem like a cage to us, <strong>many dogs prefer crates because of their natural
                        instinct to
                        sleep in caves.</strong> Crates can help a nervous dog feel secure in their own space as they
                    adjust to this
                    big change. However, dogs should not be left in their crates all day. They need exercise, play, and
                    entertainment, too.

                <h4>TIP 4: PREPARE YOURSELF FOR THE CHANGE</h4>
                <p>When a dog settles into a new home, it will take time for them to adjust to the change and feel
                    secure in new surroundings. <strong>They may respond be becoming nervous and shy.</strong> It takes
                    between days to
                    weeks for a new pet to recognize your house as their home. While they adjust, your role is to build
                    trust and provide a calm, safe place.
                </p><br>
                <h4>TIP 5: ESTABLISH ROUTINES</h4>
                <p>While transitioning to a new home is hard, <strong>your new dog will appreciate established routines
                        of
                        walking, eating, and sleeping.</strong> It will reassure them of stability and help them adjust
                    faster. Before
                    they arrive, plan when and how much to feed them. Look at your schedule and plan for daily walks.
                </p><br>
                <h4>TIP 6: INTRODUCE OTHER PETS SLOWLY</h4>
                <p>If you have other dogs at home, <strong>introduce them outside of the house on leash before bringing
                        a new
                        dog inside.</strong> Once they have said “hi” outside, you can move them inside. Keep your new
                    dog on his
                    leash and walk through the house. Let him get used to his new home in a space away from other pets
                    for the first couple days. Then slowly let them interact inside more often until they recognize each
                    other as part of the same pack.
