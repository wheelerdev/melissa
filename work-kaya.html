                <p>Carina Chaz, a 25-year-old entrepreneur who launched a successful beauty business, focuses on healthy
                    living. Her health routine includes using Cannabis. Chaz is one of many women who prefer cannabis
                    products that include THC. However, most Cannabis brands operating in the THC space market their
                    products to men, while CBD brands target women.
                </p><br>
                <h4>A quick review of CBD vs. THC</h4>
                <p> CBD (Cannabidiol) is found in the plant, cannabis. It’s linked to relieve anxiety, insomnia and
                    chronic pain. CBD does not cause a “high,” which is why some people prefer it.
                </p><br>
                <p> THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) is also found in cannabis. It’s the main psychoactive ingredient in
                    marijuana that causes people to feel “high”. Most CBD products have removed the THC, while cannabis
                    in its whole form includes both CBD and THC.
                </p><br>
                <h4>Are Women interested in THC products?</h4>
                <p>Women are using CBD products for their calming and nonpsychedelic properties. Just ask celebrity
                    Kristen Bell, who uses CBD to manager her mental health, and Melissa McCarthy who applies CBD oil to
                    help manage pain.  Yet, research shows that women are also using THC cannabis products.
                </p><br>
                <p>One report, by BDS Analytics, found that few consumers use cannabis for a single purpose. Among
                    people using cannabis for pain management, 73 percent of them also enjoy marijuana for recreational
                    and social reasons.
                </p><br>
                <p>Another report by Headset found that men buy only 5% more cannabis than women. Even with numbers
                    showing women’s support, Cannabis brands in the THC space often overlook them and market to a male
                    audience. Part of this is due to the stigma around women using cannabis, but groups and online
                    publications, like Nice Paper, are working to dispel myths and misinformation shaming cannabis.
                </p><br>
                <h4>Women using Cannabis in the THC space</h4>
                <p>Celebrity Stella Santana, daughter of Santana, recently shared her cannabis preferences in an
                    interview with Nice Paper. Santana said her favorite way to use cannabis is with the besito pen.
                    Nice Paper features interviews with other women, like entrepreneur Chaz, to de-stigmatize women
                    using cannabis.
                </p><br>
                <h4>Why is THC marketed to men and not women?</h4>
                <p>One contributing factor to the misrepresentation in marketing could be the lack of representation in
                    the male-dominant leadership of the Cannabis industry.  Despite the success of CBD-products with
                    women and, only 27 percent of cannabis companies have women in executive positions.
                </p><br>
                <p>Another contributing factor is the current federal regulations. Cannabis companies are continually
                    breaking new ground in retail as legalization moves forward. It’s a lot easier to break into a new
                    market with CBD products when marijuana is still stigmatized.
                </p><br>
                <p>As the CBD market grows, it will pave the way for THC brands to target all genders.
