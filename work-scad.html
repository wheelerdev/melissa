                SCAD Professors</h1>

            <p>By: Melissa Wheeler</p><br>
            <p>Two professors in the Savannah College of Art and Design architecture department won first place in an
                international competition focused on creating sustainable and self-sufficient homes.
            </p><br>
            <p>Dihua Yang and Ming Tang were selected out of 1,100 competitors from 90 countries, who submitted a total
                of 255 proposals to the International Self-sufficient Housing Competition from the Second Advanced
                Architecture Contest sponsored by the Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia.
            </p><br>
            <p>Entries were judged by a renowned group of architects, including Yung Ho Chang, chair of the architecture
                department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Grey Lynn, a forerunner in exploring the
                possibilities of digital fabrication. Lynn, who teaches at the University of California-Los Angeles, was
                profiled by Time Magazine in their projection of 21st-century innovators in architecture and design.
            </p><br>
            <p>Yang and Tang’s winning design used traditional local material and implemented geometry elements in a way
                that would allow structures to transform and reform themselves. The jury commended their design’s
                landscape integration and the possibility it could be constructed as a prototype.
            </p><br>
            <p>"Since the central feature of our bamboo house is the potential of re-arranging into various contexts, I
                hope this prototype could be modified and constructed by users in other locations, based on their unique
                local requirements, and adapted to fit sustainable strategy," Tang said.
