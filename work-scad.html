            <h3>As Senior Media Relations Manager for one of the largest, international art and design colleges, I
                created relationships with key media outlets, including national, international, trade and local

                Street Journal, International Herald Tribune, Delta Sky Magazine, Domino Magazine and Art in America. I
                trained students and professors for media interviews, prepared talking points and assisted writers with

                <p>By: Melissa Wheeler</p><br>
                <p>Two professors in the Savannah College of Art and Design architecture department won first place in
                    an
                    international competition focused on creating sustainable and self-sufficient homes.
                </p><br>
                <p>Dihua Yang and Ming Tang were selected out of 1,100 competitors from 90 countries, who submitted a
                    total
                    of 255 proposals to the International Self-sufficient Housing Competition from the Second Advanced
                    Architecture Contest sponsored by the Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia.
                </p><br>
                <p>Entries were judged by a renowned group of architects, including Yung Ho Chang, chair of the
                    architecture
                    department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Grey Lynn, a forerunner in exploring
                    the
                    possibilities of digital fabrication. Lynn, who teaches at the University of California-Los Angeles,
                    was
                    profiled by Time Magazine in their projection of 21st-century innovators in architecture and design.
                </p><br>
                <p>Yang and Tang’s winning design used traditional local material and implemented geometry elements in a
                    way
                    that would allow structures to transform and reform themselves. The jury commended their design’s
                    landscape integration and the possibility it could be constructed as a prototype.
                </p><br>
                <p>"Since the central feature of our bamboo house is the potential of re-arranging into various
                    contexts, I
                    hope this prototype could be modified and constructed by users in other locations, based on their
                    unique
                    local requirements, and adapted to fit sustainable strategy," Tang said.
